# 🎓 ECE Attendance System

Welcome to the ECE Attendance System! This tool is designed to make tracking attendance at our events fast, easy, and accurate.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

As a new user, follow these steps to get started:

1.  **Login**: Use the credentials provided by your team lead to access the dashboard.
2.  **The Dashboard**: Once logged in, you'll see three main areas:
    *   **QR Scanner**: Point your camera at a student's ID/QR code to mark them present instantly.
    *   **Live Statistics**: Watch the numbers grow! This section shows how many students have registered and how many are present today.
    *   **Reports**: Need a list of attendees? You can download them as PDF or Excel files.

## 📱 How to Mark Attendance

There are two ways to mark a student as present:
*   **Method 1 (Fastest)**: Use the "Scan QR Code" window. It uses your device camera.
*   **Method 2 (Manual)**: If the QR code is blurry or not working, type the Roll Number into the box and click **Submit**.

## 📊 Live Tracking
The numbers you see on the dashboard update **automatically**. You don't even need to refresh the page! This helps everyone stay updated on the attendance counts in real-time.
